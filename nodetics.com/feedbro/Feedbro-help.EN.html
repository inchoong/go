<h3>Service Plugins</h3>
<p class="content">
Feedbro provides built-in support for several popular services like YouTube Channels, YouTube Search, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, VK.com, 
Yammer, Vimeo, Bitchute, SlideShare, Reddit, Pinterest, Rumble, Telegram, LinkedIn Groups, LinkedIn Home Feed and LinkedIn Job Search.
<br><br>
Just navigate to a page in such a service, click Feedbro WebExtension icon and then choose "Find Feeds in Current Tab" to see if the page is supported.
</p>

<h3>Create Rules to Filter and Manage Articles</h3>
<p class="content">
Under "Rules" menu you can define custom Rules that are trigged either when a new article arrives or when an article is viewed.
Rule can e.g. highlight the article border, add a tag, highlight specific words, display a desktop notification, play a sound,
trigger IFTTT action, hide or delete the article.
</p>

<h3>Sort Articles by Points</h3>
<p class="content">
In Feedbro you can sort articles by date (newest first, oldest first) or by points (most points first, if articles have equal points, newest first). This can
be adjusted using the select box in the Feedbro toolbar.
<br><br>
To assign points to articles, you need to create a Rule (or several) under Rules menu. Define conditions based on which points should be added and then add 
action "Add Points" with number as parameter (e.g. 1). The power of this feature is that it allows you to raise or "bubble up" important articles or feeds.
For example if you are following 100 YouTube channels with Feedbro, some of them might be more important than others. By creating rules that give more points
to certain channel feeds than others, you can get them listed in priority order.
</p>

<h3>Convert Partial Articles in Feeds to Full-Text Articles</h3>
<p class="content">
Feedbro has built-in engine for transforming partial text feed articles to full-text articles. This feature is not automatically on for all feeds and
must be enabled per feed. To do that, right-click the feed in the feed tree and select Properties. Then use "Feed Entry Content" for adjusting
full text extraction settings. Click "Preview" button to check that you get desired results and then press "Save".
<br><br>
Note that obviously full-text option should not be used if the feed already provides full articles. Also the full-text conversion doesn't
work for all feeds and sites but it works pretty well for majority of sites.
</p>

<h3>Setup Discord channel Rule action</h3>

<p class="content">
When creating a Rule, choose action "Discord HTTP POST URL". 
<br><br>
With this action you can send the article title and its link to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://discordapp.com/">Discord</a> channel that
you can also monitor with your mobile phone in real time. The argument is the Webhook URL that you can get from Discord UI when you click the small "cog" icon on the right side
of the channel name (with "Edit Channel" tooltip), click "Webhooks" and then "Create Webhook" button. Name the Webhook e.g. "Feedbro" and then copy the Webhook URL and save
the Webhook. Then paste the URL to Feedbro rule action parameter field.
<br><br>
The URL looks something like this:<br>
https://discordapp.com/api/webhooks/123496711234906261/1234iIIimYkjIvG2gSvgyJkE7wX_YEdvWjJVggWwMMiR6Qr14viwDvy3XxII9raLQFsD

</p>

<h3>Setup Slack channel Rule action</h3>

<p class="content">
When creating a Rule, choose action "Slack HTTP POST URL". 
<br><br>
With this action you can send the article title and its link directly to a <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a> channel. 
The argument is the Webhook URL that you can get from <a rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks">Slack UI</a> when adding a Webhook app.
<br><br>
The URL looks something like this:<br>
https://hooks.slack.com/services/1234YVBJ69H/1234XC28CGM/123YqU28765XZnTtCQ22KVB
</p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p class="content">
<dl>

<dt>Help! Firefox <span class="highlight">doesn't load</span> any articles!</dt>
<dd>Your Firefox profile is most likely corrupted. When this happens, IndexedDB API stops working which breaks Feedbro. You can test your IndexedDB API functionality with
<a href="https://firefox-storage-test.glitch.me/" target="_blank">this tool</a>. If IndexedDB is indeed broken, open <b>about:support</b>
and click "Refresh Firefox". WARNING! This will remove all your add-ons and their settings so backup your data first!
</dd>

<dt>Help! I have some other <span class="highlight">technical problem</span>!</dt>
<dd>Please check <a href="KNOWNISSUES.txt">this list</a> for known issues. If you can't find an answer there, please contact us at <a href="mailto:feedbro.reader@gmail.com">feedbro.reader@gmail.com</a>
</dd>

<dt>How can I view <span class="highlight">just the unread</span> articles?</dt>
<dd>Enable "Show only unread" mode by either clicking the star+letter icon in the toolbar or press 'u' and then reload the view (click the feed in the tree or press 'r').</dd>

<dt>How can I view an <span class="highlight">article within Feedbro</span> when using view mode 2, 4 or 5?</dt>
<dd>Don't click the article title. Instead, click elsewhere in the article area to expand the content within Feedbro.</dd>

<dt>How can I get a <span class="highlight">desktop notification</span> of new articles?</dt>
<dd>To get a desktop notification when a new article arrives, you need to create a new Rule under Rules menu. Select "Desktop notification" as the action.</dd>

<dt>How can I get an <span class="highlight">email notification</span> of new articles?</dt>
<dd>First create a webhook with <a href="https://ifttt.com/maker_webhooks" target="_blank">IFTTT.com Maker channel</a> so that you get an URL that can be used to trigger email sending. Then create a Rule in Feedbro that has IFTTT Maker channel action
and that URL as the parameter.</dd>

<dt>How can I save <span class="highlight">more than 100 articles</span> per feed?</dt>
<dd>Right-click the feed in the feed tree and select Properties. You can then adjust the "Maximum articles to save" to even 2000. Then click "Save". Note that initially
most XML feeds provide only the latest 10-20 articles. So you can't typically get all articles from the past when you add the feed. Only the latest ones.</dd>

<dt>How can I get <span class="highlight">Reddit</span> feeds to work?</dt>
<dd>
You must disable tracker protection for Reddit since Firefox blocks all XMLHttpRequests to Reddit by default.<br>
First open <a href="https://reddit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit.com</a> and then click the small shield icon on the left side of the URL bar. Then
use the slider to disable "Enhanced Tracking Protection is ON for this site". See <a href="https://imgur.com/a/xTHkolz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this image</a>.
<br><br>
If that doesn't work, open about:preferences#privacy and choose "Custom" under "Enhanced Tracking Protection" and pick "Only in Private Windows" for the 
"Tracking content" selection box.
</dd>

<dt>How can I get <span class="highlight">shorter update interval</span> for my feed?</dt>
<dd>Right-click the feed in the feed tree, select Properties and then adjust the "Scan Interval" setting. It can be as low as 1 minute.</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">import my bookmarks</span> from Firefox or Chrome?</dt>
<dd>Open Options page and use "Import Firefox Bookmarks (as OPML)" button.</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">preview</span> a feed?</dt>
<dd>Click the Feedbro extension icon and choose "Find Feeds in Current Tab". Then click the blue eye icon to preview the selected feed.</dd>

<dt>How can I get <span class="highlight">full articles</span> for a feed instead of partial articles?</dt>
<dd>Right-click the feed in the feed tree, select Properties and then use "Feed Entry Content" setting. Select either "Full article body" or
"Full article body with article main image" and click "Preview" to check that you get articles properly. Then click "Save". Note that
this will only affect the new articles that will be loaded after you have chosen this setting. In other words already loaded articles are not
affected.</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">reload all feeds manually</span>?</dt>
<dd>To reload all feeds you have manually, click the blue reload icon in the top left-hand corner in the Feedbro toolbar. To reload
all feeds under a specific folder, right-click the folder and select "Update Feeds in Folder"</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">sort articles by author</span>?</dt>
<dd>This is not directly possible. However, it is likely that you want to follow/sort articles by just certain selected people and not everyone.
You can create a Rule under Rules menu which assigns a certain tag if the author of the article is one of the persons you want to follow.
If you want, you can create a new tag per author.</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">get notified of any new articles on the Internet that match my search</span>?</dt>
<dd>You can use <a href="https://www.google.com/alerts" target="_blank">Google Alerts</a> to create a custom search that generates an RSS feed. Then subscribe to that in Feedbro.</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">delete a feed</span>?</dt>
<dd>Right-click the feed in the feed tree and select "Delete".</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">create subfolders</span>?</dt>
<dd>To keep things simple, Feedbro does not support subfolders.</dd>

<dt>Where can I find <span class="highlight">sound effects for Rules</span>?</dt>
<dd>There are several sites that host free sound effects on the Internet. One of them is <a href="https://freesound.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freesound.org</a>.
You can get the sound clip URL if you open Development Console and Network view and filter by media before you click play on the site.
</dd>

<dt>Does Feedbro have a <span class="highlight">search function</span>?</dt>
<dd>Currently Feedbro does not support full-text search. The reason is that HTML5 IndexedDB engine does not support it natively and while
it would be possible to implement full-text search as a layer, it would have significant impact on performance. It's also quite challenging to
write language stemmers for different languages. 
<br><br>
However, you can use Rules to assign tags to articles. Tags can be then accessed via the Tags 
menu and by clicking a Tag you can instantly find articles with that Tag.
</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">translate Feedbro UI to another language</span>?</dt>
<dd>Currently Feedbro supports English and Finnish out-of-the-box. You can choose the language in Options. You can also download the locale template
and create a new translation (remember to edit the meta data as well). Then upload the translated file to e.g. github and import the translated locale to Feedbro.
This way you can translate Feedbro to any language you want (except the Help file). And when people put locale files online and share the links, it benefits everyone. If you want to
have your translated locale file included in Feedbro, please contact us at feedbro.reader@gmail.com
<br><br>
If you host the locale on github, please update the meta-data in the JSON to include your data in "locale_author_email" and "locale_author_name" and ensure that
"locale_source_url" points to the actual JSON file (URL starts with https://raw.githubusercontent.com/). You also need to provide the "raw" URL when importing the locale.
<br><br>
Links to existing translations can be found on <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/feedbroreader/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a>.
</dd>

<dt>How can I <span class="highlight">download YouTube subscriptions as OPML</span>?</dt>
<dd>
You can export your YouTube subscriptions on <a href="https://takeout.google.com/u/1/takeout/custom/youtube" rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a> as JSON.
<br><br>
Once you have received the YouTube subscriptions JSON file, you can import it using the "Import Feed Subscriptions (as OPML)" button
on Feedbro's options page. Feedbro will automatically convert the file to OPML and import your subscriptions under "YouTube" folder.
</dd>

<dt>Why don't you use <span class="highlight">chrome.storage.sync / Firefox sync</span> for synchronizing feed subscription and feed entry data?</dt>
<dd>Unfortunately <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/storage#property-sync" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chrome.storage.sync API</a> that Firefox also uses has very strict limitations regarding the amount of data you can store. It also throttles
the number of API requests per hour. That API does not provide enough space even for storing the feed subscription data and certainly cannot be used for handling
feed entry data.
</dd>

<dt>Why do select boxes and input fields look <span class="highlight">ugly</span> on Chrome 83+?</dt>
<dd>Chrome updated the default rending of form elements and it's ugly. You can disable it here: chrome://flags/#form-controls-refresh</dd>

<dt>Why isn't <span class="highlight">Twitter integration</span> working?</dt>
<dd>Twitter integration requires that you allow twitter.com domain to set cookies. Please ensure that you are not blocking that.</dd>

<dt>Why isn't <span class="highlight">LinkedIn integration</span> working?</dt>
<dd>LinkedIn integration requires that you allow www.linkedin.com domain to set cookies. Please ensure that you are not blocking that.</dd>

<dt>Why isn't <span class="highlight">Instagram integration</span> working?</dt>
<dd>Instagram can temporarily IP ban you if you scan for multiple profiles frequently without being logged on. 
Being logged on to Instagram should in most cases prevent blocking.</dd>
